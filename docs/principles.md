# Design principles

## Design for the web
The art must be friendly to RGB color mode.

## Scalable
The art must be designed from the smallest appropriate size first. Larger sizes are determined by a whole number multiplier. For example, if the logo is 16px square, the next size it can be reproduced while maintaining crisp edges is 32px square. Any size not following this pattern must be redesigned specifically for that size.

## Vector
Design first in vector.

# Reproduction

In this exercise, the [official Block IU art](../prior-art/README.md)
is going to be examined for areas of improvement and reproduced in a way that
follows certain [design principles](principles.md) while remaining faithful
to the original art.

## Designed for print

Upon opening [`iu_tab.eps`](../prior-art/iu_tab.eps), it's apparent for two reasons
that this was designed for print, with little consideration of the web medium.
First, the color mode is set as [CMYK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model),
not [RGB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model). Second, the document
unit is set as [points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)), not
[pixels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel).

## Anchor points

Another concern is that the coordinates for all 34 anchor points of the Block IU
contain decimal numbers, rather than whole numbers. Since a monitor can't
physically render anything smaller than a pixel, it fakes these sub-pixels by
applying a blurring technique known as
[anti-aliasing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing).
However, given the predominantly
[rectilinear polygonal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectilinear_polygon)
geometry of the Block IU, the anchor points should snap to whole numbers,
resulting in crisp horizontal and vertical edges.

If `iu_tab.eps` is to the be vector source file from which raster files are to
be generated, it will be impossible to generate crisp edges at the current,
a smaller, or larger scale. By not correcting these misplaced anchor points,
the vector art counteracts the bold strength the
[monogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogram) is trying to convey.

In order to best illustrate the severity of these decimal anchor points,
an [SVG version](../prior-art/iu_tab.svg) of the original
[EPS file](../prior-art/iu_tab.eps) was generated.

## Dimensions

If the coordinates of the anchor points should change, then perhaps it's best to
first examine the dimensions of the monogram. If the dimensions of `107.294pt`
wide by `135.402pt` high is tweaked, perhaps it can be reimagined as a more
reasonable aspect ratio, ideally scalable from a smaller size.

The most stable aspect of the monogram is the three vertical stems,
dividing the monogram's width into three equal columns. Therefore, if the width
of the art is divisible by three, then there's a higher likelihood of retaining
crisp edges.

![Three columns of the monogram](images/guide-02.png)

By examining closer, we can get a better sense for the intended inner dimensions
of the monogram. Assuming the width of one edge of the
[serif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) is one unit wide, then the potential
width of the [vertical bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface_anatomy) is
either two or three serif-widths wide. However, if the 45-degree raise of the
`U` is to align properly, then three serif-widths wide is the most reasonable
option.

![Columns either 4 or 5 units wide](images/guide-03.png)

Therefore, if the monogram is to have any chance of working along a horizontal
dimension, then the minimal width of the monogram must be `15 units`.

```
serif-width = 1 unit
vertical-bar-width = 3 units
stem-width = serif-width + vertical-bar-width + serif-width = 5 units
monogram-width = stem-width * 3 = 15 units
```

With a known minimum width of `15 units`, then the minimum height must be
`19 units` to maintain the original aspect ratio.

```
original-ratio = 107.294 / 135.402
original-ratio = 15 / height
height = 15 / original-ratio = 18.929576677 ~= 19
```

## Inner proportions

With minimum dimensions of `15 × 19 units` determined, a series of assumptions
illustrated by horizontal and vertical guides can help derive the inner
proportions of the Block IU from the original `iu_tab.eps` file.

### Assumption 1

Assume all four serifs share the same dimension of `5 × 2 units`.

![Serifs](images/guide-04.png)

### Assumption 2

Assume the lower segment of the `I` connecting to the base of the `U` is the
same `2 unit` height of the serifs.

![I connector](images/guide-05.png)

### Assumption 3

Assume the height of the `U` horizontal bar is the same as the `3 unit` width
of the two `U` vertical bars.

![U horizontal bar](images/guide-06.png)

### Assumption 4

Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the remaining heights of the `U`
vertical bar should be `7 units`.

![U vertical bar](images/guide-07.png)

### Combining assumptions

Combining these assumptions produces the intended inner proportions of the
monogram at `15 × 19 units`.

## Colors

The [crimson color is defined](http://brand.iu.edu/apply/color.shtml) as the
following, in various color modes:

Color | Pantone | CMYK | RGB
:--|:--|---|---|---
Crimson | 201 | `C0 M100 Y63 K29` | `#7D110C`

`iu_tab.eps` is set in CMYK mode because it's intended for print. When exporting
this print file for the web, the crimson color incorrectly converts to a softer
variation (`#A41F35`), rather than to the intended color (`#7D110C`).
To resolve this, all colors must be set to their intended RGB colors after
setting the document color mode to RGB.

## Illustration

By illustrating the monogram using corrected dimensions, inner proportions, and
colors, the new Block IU (shown first) is significantly improved over its
scaled-down predecessor (shown second).

![New monogram at 1x scale](images/block-iu-25x29-new-1x.png)![Old monogram at 1x scale](images/block-iu-25x29-old-1x.png)

To better showcase the differences, the artwork is scaled to 10 times the
original size.

![New monogram at 10x scale](images/block-iu-25x29-new-10x.png)![Old monogram at 10x scale](images/block-iu-25x29-old-10x.png)

With anchor points snapping to whole numbers, the SVG version of the monogram
is simpler and smaller than the original.
